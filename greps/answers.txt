# Part 2
### a)
this following lines shows me how many pokemon there are
cd captured
ggrep -P "zcw|quu" < ./* -c


### b)

this following line shows me how many lines per file match the regex
ggrep -P -r -c ".*" captured/

but we can also use this command
wc -l captured/*

using this command, we know that the three biggest pokemon by number
of lines is charizard, pikachu, beedrill
